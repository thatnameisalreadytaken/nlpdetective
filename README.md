FOSS to identify NLP in texts and speech.

Rationale:  Some articles we read are biased by using NLP techniques.  This project aims to assess the level of bias of an article e.g. is it positive, negative, motivational or demotivational.  In this way, you are empowered to decide what content is beneficial to you.
